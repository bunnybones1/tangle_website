        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            Tangle is an open-source library that takes unnetworked WebAssembly and automatically makes it
            multiplayer.
            <br>
            The Wasm program does not need to worry about message passing, serialization, or consensus. From its
            perspective it's not even networked!
            <br>
            The Wasm programs are effectively 'entangled' like quantum particles.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Tangle good for?</h2>
        <p>
            Tangle makes it far easier to build multiplayer apps and games.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future Tangle may be useful for syncing programs between servers / clients, untrusted plugins in
            networked software, 'metaverse'-like scripting, backend-less collaborative software, and more!
        </p>
        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p>
            Tangle is a free and open-source library.
            <br>
            Connections are peer to peer and I run a free server that facilitates those connections.
            <br>
            If there is demand I will consider offering paid services that can handle more traffic and give Tangle
            server-backed super-powers. Stay tuned for more on that later.
        </p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            Tangle syncs initial state and networks all subsequent inputs that could cause simulations to
            diverge. Tangle keeps every bit identical between all connected Wasm instances.
            <br>
            'Snapshots' are taken at each simulation step to enable 'rewinding' and 'replaying' events to
            ensure all peers apply events in the same order, without adding latency to user input.
        </p>
        <h2>What are its limits?</h2>
        <p>Due to how rollback works frequently updated programs will have increased input latency
            if they do not keep CPU
            and memory usage low. This is an area that will see future improvement.
        <p>
            Tangle does nothing to merge long stretches of offline editing. It is not a CRDT.
        </p>
        <h2>WARNING</h2>
        <p>
            Tangle is incredibly new. <br>
            It has plenty of bugs, missing features, and is absolutely not production
            ready!
